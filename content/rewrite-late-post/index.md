> N.B. I totally forgot to finish this post, so I'll just leave it at this.

Iâ€™ve been cooped up at home for the past week â€” I had a covid-19 scare but it seems I just had a regular viral infection ðŸ˜…. I had aspirations and plans going into quarantine in March, but Iâ€™ve not experienced this as much. I finally got the rewrite of my website up today though â€” I was inspired by [Frank Chimeroâ€™s](https://frankchimero.com) series about his [experience](https://frankchimero.com/blog/2019/redesign/) rewriting his website. I took his concept of starting with:

```css
p {
  font-family: Georgia, serif;
  line-height: 1.5;
  max-width: 33em;
}
```

I also moved the previous versions of my website to <https://v1.jasik.xyz> and <https://v2.jasik.xyz> a la [Chris Krycho](https://v4.chriskrycho.com/2019/my-final-round-of-url-rewrites-ever.html). Iâ€™m still serving my main site as <https://jasik.xyz> so Iâ€™m not exactly doing this whole idea at the moment, but I think itâ€™s a good first step. All of the posts from both previous iterations exist on this website anyways so I shouldnâ€™t have any problems linking to previous posts. Itâ€™s mostly just nice to be able to see different snapshots of my site, even though I havenâ€™t done much with it.
