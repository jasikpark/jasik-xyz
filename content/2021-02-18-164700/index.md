I'm excited I just read [MVP Soundsystem](https://frankchimero.com/blog/2018/mvp-soundsystem/){{< raw-wayback title="MVP Soundsystem" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210218230852/https://frankchimero.com/blog/2018/mvp-soundsystem/" >}} by Frank Chimero, and he talked about using [Playlist Converter](http://www.playlist-converter.net/#/){{< raw-wayback title="Playlist Converter" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210218231027/https://www.playlist-converter.net/" >}} to move from Rdio to Spotify. I've been looking for something that would allow me to share playlists on all platforms for a while, and apparently [Soundiiz](https://soundiiz.com/){{< raw-wayback title="Soundiiz" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210218231039/https://soundiiz.com/" >}} and [Tune My Music](https://www.tunemymusic.com/){{< raw-wayback title="Tune My Music" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210218231241/https://www.tunemymusic.com/" >}} will both do that for you.
