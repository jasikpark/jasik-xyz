I found [Design Systems for Developers by Ethan Marcotte](https://thegymnasium.com/courses/course-v1:GYM+019+0/about) from reading [Frontend Mentor Newsletter #55](https://mailchi.mp/11d7dcdfa8f5/frontend-mentor-newsletter-vol-55?e=e6ef03954b). It seems pretty cool.

<p><a href="https://thegymnasium.com/">Aquent Gymnasium</a> - I recently came across Aquent Gymnasium after hearing about a free course called <a href="https://thegymnasium.com/courses/course-v1:GYM+019+0/about">Design Systems for Developers by Ethan Marcotte</a>. I learned a lot during the course, and it seems like they've got many other free courses worth checking out!</p>
