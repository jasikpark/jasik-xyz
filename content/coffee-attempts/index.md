- 1:55pm
- White Russian Coffee
- Moka pot
- Grind no. 7
- 27.0g of coffee

_notes:_ Wtf - grind no. 7 + 27g was wayyyyy too much coffee???
I only used (27-8.5) 18.5g of coffee?? I guess I’ll do that next time. It turned out well - I made two iced White Russian lattes: Ice, a lil vanilla extract, simple syrup, and some milk and heavy cream whisked together by my protein shaker. It’s pretty great imo since I’m using the right amount of coffee for myself. I think if I want to use the Moka pot more frequently, I need a good grinder and a smaller Moka pot. Especially since I mostly enjoy iced drinks.

I started keeping track of my coffee making attempts with a goal of replicating [Carport Coffee's](https://caffeinatethepeople.com) coffee. Here is my journal.

- Carport Coffee
- Moka pot
- Grind size no. 7
- 27.0g of coffee

It’s ok — definitely could use some milk or other creamer.

- 8:56am
- Carport Coffee
- Moka pot
- Grind Size No. 5
- 27g of coffee
- 145.2g of coffee out

_notes:_ I have no clue what I had the grinder on before, but I expect it was a lot higher than No. 5. That took like 5 minutes to grind all those beans.

A No. 7 next time.

**THURSDAY, May 21, 2020**

- 5:44pm
- Carport Coffee
- Grind size No. 5
- Mr. Coffee espresso machine
- 16g coffee
- 186.3g water in
- 119.7g of milk to be frothed
- 90g of espresso out

_notes:_ hmmmmmm

It certainly is a cappuccino

I’m uncertain about it.

- 4:43pm
- White Russian coffee
- Grind size No. 5
- Mr. Coffee espresso machine
- 16.2g of coffee
- 343.3g - 171.5g in = 171.8g of water in
- I need 80g of espresso output to gauge when to start steaming my milk. I may have used too much coffee though.

_notes:_ So.. I do have espresso and foam. It doesn’t smell bad. I forgot to put something between my scale and my cup so I’m a little concerned but it should be fine. It doesn’t exactly taste like their coffee. Mostly just tastes burnt. Which I have now realized is because I used the White Russian beans. In that case it tastes pretty good?

- 12:01pm
- ~~Let’s try a grind size of 7?~~ No. 5
- With 27g of coffee.
- 160.4g coffee output

*notes:*Whelp I left it on the grind setting I used for the allspice, so I _think_ it’s No. 5 though I forgot to keep the handle on so that the adjustments would be accurate.

I warmed up some milk in the small pan that Shelly gave me on the “warm zone” on the stove and tried to foam it with the French press but a las I was thwarted by it’s brokenness. I need either a new French press or a tiny zip zip milk frother. I would say that the making of the coffee was much more manageable since the water stayed in the brewer the whole time instead of spewing out, but I think I’ll try a No. 6 next time or maybe a No. 5 a second time since I’m not totally sure that was the actual grind size.

It is strong, but a little harsh. I think I want a very slightly larger grind size.

**WEDNESDAY, May 20, 2020**

- 10:43am
- Grind size of 23 next.
- Nvm we’re trying grind no. 10 - 23 seemed way too big.
- 25.3g of coffee
- 200g of coffee output - I wish I had stopped the brew sooner so I didn’t get the last dregs of bitter coffee in it.

_notes:_ It smells good, that’s for certain. It was good, but I believe it could definitely go a finer grind.

- 11:10am
- Grind size of 8 perhaps
- 27g of coffee
- 184g of coffee output

_notes:_ I tried filling it on an oven mitt for less heat loss. I think it worked? I’m not sure exactly.

**TUESDAY, May 19, 2020**

- 5:27pm
- 16.6g Carport Coffee blend from Little Dreamer coffee

_notes:_

- 6:00pm
- 26.7g coffee
- I filled the coffee bit to the top with a really coarse grind… I’m going to try no. 10 grind next.

_notes:_

- 6:08pm
- Ok, maybe I’ll try another still kinda coarse grind after this.

_notes:_ that brew was pretty good, but I think I want it to be stronger, so a finer grind next time, the beans are very caffeinated, which is nice. Apparently I’m supposed to fill the Moka pot to the top with grounds, so I think I want to buy myself a smaller one so I can make more espresso-like coffees.
