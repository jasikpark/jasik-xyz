**RECENTLY**

I have been having an *ok* time. 

I totally miscalculated how much money I would have after paying rent, and I haven't suddenly taken up cooking as much as I hoped, and I got my bike stolen.

Meh.

I have been working on a new other web dev job though, but it hasn't panned out money-wise yet.
