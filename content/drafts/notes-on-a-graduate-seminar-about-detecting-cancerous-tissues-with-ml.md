The presentation was given by Nikos Papanikolopoulos, a McKnight Presidential Endowed Professor at the University of Minnesota. He's also worked with Mitsubishi in their MERL lab, and with the Roswell Cancer Institute.

He was asked for help with the delineation of cancerous tissue. The concept is that they would take the images of tissue and determine the bounds of cancerous tissue.
