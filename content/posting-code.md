Here's a little "Hello World" code snippet to show how C++ highlighting works on
the website. I wonder if adding Github gists is a better idea, but idk. It's
fine.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "hello world";
}
```

## Here's a Github Gist version of that:

I definitely like the Github Gist version more than the website's.
