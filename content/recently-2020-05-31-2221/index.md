Inspired by Tom MacWright’s [_Recently_](https://macwright.org/2020/03/01/recently.html) posts, here’s what’s been going on with me!

## Music

I got my vinyl copy of _Nothing Happens_ by Wallows on Thursday and I’m delighted :)

I also discovered Su Lee through kyuuwaii’s [cover](https://youtu.be/St8GNdVETLI) of [Can’t Get Over You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8avxE0yPgE) by Joji aka Pink Guy, which was fun. She is wonderful.

## Reading

I don’t know when the last time I read a book was, but I have been itching for a reread of the Eragon series in order to read the first book in the sequel series.

I do spend a lot of time reading my many RSS feeds I’ve subscribed to in [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com). Here’s some of the articles I’ve read recently:

- [🔎Julia Evans🔍 on Twitter: “take on hard projects(from my zine “so you want to be a wizard” https://t.co/kSR3wloMSn)… “](https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1249024380874752001)

- [Why does writing matter in remote work? — Tim Casasola](https://www.timcasasola.com/blog/writing)

This is one of the reasons why I made this blog, but I’ve been slow to post to it, in exchange for fidgeting with the design.

- [Linkrot - macwright.org](https://macwright.org/2020/05/02/linkrot.html)

  You can see my middling attempts at solving this problem in [A Day on the Trails]({{< ref "day-on-the-trails" >}}). I added the Internet Archive snapshots of the links in that post as small icons right after the canonical links.

- [Short-form vs long-form posts - Jonnie Hallman (@destroytoday)](https://2020.destroytoday.com/blog/short-form-vs-long-form-posts)
- [Kimberly Hirsh - This is not a polished blog.](https://kimberlyhirsh.com/2020/05/27/this-is-not.html)

  These two have inspired me to add notes vs. posts to my site and to aim for more flow rather than substance in my blog.

- [Pseudo-Randomly Adding Illustrations with CSS – Eric’s Archived Thoughts](https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2020/04/15/pseudo-randomly-adding-illustrations-with-css/)

  This is a crazy-cool way to very-pseudo-randomly generated an order for a set of background illustrations - I will be glad if I can someday make use of illustrations as much as [Eric Meyer](https://meyerweb.com/) or [Tom MacWright](https://macwright.org)

I’m hoping that in the theme of [zettelkasten](https://macwright.org/2020/02/01/recently.html#a-second-brain) I can post more useful tidbits of information that can be useful for both myself and y’all. I remember a post from Chris Krycho (do you see a theme here?) about [using his blog as a public notebook](https://v4.chriskrycho.com/2018/blog-as-note-taking-tool.html), and I definitely vibe with that idea.

## Drinks

In November I [stopped drinking coffee](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/decaffeinating/) and soft drinks and started taking Vitamin D supplements and using the Rise sleep app to track my sleep in a non-didactic way, and I had a good experience. [Carport Cofffee](https://caffeinatethepeople.com) is an active hindrance on this plan though. They have delicious coffee and take great consideration in their brewing and water filtration.

Recently I stole back my Moka pot and Mr. Coffee espresso machine from my friends and family and have tried my hand at perfecting an at-home cup of Carport blend coffee. I haven’t had the best of luck, since I have the cheapest hand-powered burr grinder possible — a JavaPresse. It was \$30 and definitely better than a blade grinder, but terrible in global terms of grinders. Especially compared to a set of beautiful commercial-grade electric burr grinders. I’ve kept track of my attempts in [Bear.app](https://bear.app) and you can see them at [Coffee Attempts]({{< ref "coffee-attempts" >}}).

I bought a [Fuzion Digital Kitchen Scale 3000g/ 0.1g](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07L92PSMP/) at the recommendation of [James Hoffman](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMb0O2CdPBNi-QqPk5T3gsQ) and it is wonderful! It is 0.01g accurate up to 500g so it is great for measuring coffee beans and baking with. I was able to make some [Japanese milk bread](https://www.carolinescooking.com/japanese-milk-bread/) at my friend’s recommendation and it was absolutely delicious.
