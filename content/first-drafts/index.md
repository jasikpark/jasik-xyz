So I've been considering designing a simple ledge for the living room of my roommate and I - we need a place for a water dispenser and it would be nice to have a ledge right for the blu-ray player.

## Shopping List:

- **3** metal wall brackets to mount into the studs
- **1** 6 foot plank of wood - at least 2 inches in thickness, 4 inches in width/depth
- **4** 45” / 3’ 9” legs — idk whether they will be wood or metal yet. Probably wood?

## Design:

1 square grid = 4 inches (mostly)
