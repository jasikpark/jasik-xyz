I kinda want to keep track of fonts that I think are cool, so I think I'll keep track of them in a list here.

- <https://www.typewolf.com/site-of-the-day/hetime>
- <https://gt-walsheim.com/>
-  <https://fontwerk.com/en/fonts/nikolai> – this is the energy I want for this website I think… something like Georgia but a lil spicy. ~~Algebra is a little more geometric, no?~~ This is the font that I saw at <https://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/algebra/> and I keep forgetting that font websites don't usually set the title of their reviews in the font they are reviewing. I'm used to years of staring at Google Docs and Google Fonts listings where the font name is set in the font, which is honestly unfair to many fonts with interesting short names.
-  <https://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/roslindale-variable-italic/> – Roslindale seems pretty <dfn><abbr def="'shm' shmooshed together with 'cool'">shmool</abbr></dfn>
-  <https://franziskaweitgruber.com/de/veronese-revival> – oomf this is related to Nikolai font? It's amazing!
-  <https://www.colophon-foundry.org/typefaces/columba/> - Columbia is pretty nice - there's a banner, text, and ruby variant for display, text, and small sizes.
-  [Fraunces](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fraunces?preview.text_type=custom#standard-styles) is fun :D - It has a `wonk` Opentype axis.
-  [Century Supra](https://mbtype.com/fonts/century-supra/) is a reimagination of Century Schoolbook by Mathew Butterick. I'm mildly tempted to make use of it for Bowl of TARDIS?
-  I think that [Chronicle](https://www.typography.com/fonts/chronicle-text/overview) might be the one for me to use for my website, since it very much has a similar energy to Georgia, very much newspaper-esque, while having a little more unique character.

Font books I might read **someday**: <https://medium.design/whitespace-8b92273ab49e>

- [Magyar Nemzet](https://bboxtype.com/typefaces/FFF_Magyar_Nemzet/#!layout=specimen) is an interesting super compressed display font that is inpired as a newspaper display font.
- [Nepsza Badsag](https://bboxtype.com/typefaces/FFF_NEPSZA_BADSAG/#!layout=specimen) is also quite interesting as a serif display font from the same site ([Fonts for Freedom](https://fonts-for-freedom.com/en/)).
- [Guendem](https://bboxtype.com/typefaces/FFF_Guendem/#!layout=specimen) is another FFF display font that really vibes with 
- [Source Serif](https://adobe-fonts.github.io/source-serif/) seems like a great option for an alternative to Georgia for me that's free and opensource
