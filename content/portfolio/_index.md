A single page app for a lo-fi radio business, giving their listeners a more enjoyable venue to access their stream. Created a custom API for the site hooking up [Spotify](https://spotify.com) and [Odesli](https://odesli.co) into a streamlined song search -> song links api perfect for the usecase we needed.

Overhauled a neglected WordPress website into an updated accessible design that loads in half the time and cuts hosting costs in half. Took the core of the WordPress website design and reimplemented it in the new medium of a [statically generated website](https://jamstack.org/what-is-jamstack/) via [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Netlify](https://netlify.com) were my main weapons, in addition to writing [semantic HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML).

Designed a landing page for my brother's fledgling baking business. This ended up being more of a passion project than actually being used, but it was an enjoyable venture in learning about CSS grid and setting up data APIs and such. I also managed to design this website without javascript, even the menu menu simply uses HTML anchors, `scroll-margin-top`, and CSS media queries to dynamically show/hide the menu on mobile.
