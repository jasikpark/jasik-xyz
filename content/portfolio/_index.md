A single page app for a lo-fi radio business, allowing their listeners to use a more enjoyable venue to access their stream than the regular youtube live page. Created a custom API for the site hooking up [Spotify](https://spotify.com) and [Odesli](https://odesli.co) into a streamlined song search -> song links api perfect for the usecase we needed.

Totally overhauled a neglected Wordpress website into an updated and accessible design that loads in half the time and cut costs to host in half. Using Tailwindcss and Netlify as my main weapons, in addition to writing semantic HTML that's accessible v.s. the setup previously on the website.

Redesigned my friends blog, helping him move from [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/) to a custom design using [Zola](https://getzola.org) for the site generation. Provided a custom theme, font choices and full transfer of all of his original writing.

Designed a landing page for my brother's fledgling baking business. This ended up being more of a passion project than actually being used, but it was an enjoyable venture in learning about CSS grid and setting up data api's and such.
