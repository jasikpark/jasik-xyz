Reuters has a [good page](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tips/) describing multiple secure ways to report a tip to them. Most reputable new sites with their stuff together will have a page like this and will use this software.

[Signal](https://www.signal.org/) is a good app for sending end-to-end encrypted messages. Whatsapp implements the same encryption algorithm, but they are owned by FACEBOOK and so therefore are not to be quite as trusted.

[PGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) is a method of encrypting email that only encrypts the content of the email, not the subject, email addresses, or names.
