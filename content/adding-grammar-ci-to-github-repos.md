I've been trying to figure out what sort of tests are appropriate for this blog.
I've finally remembered that grammar and spelling are important and initially
looked at [YaSpellerCI](https://github.com/ai/yaspeller-ci) as an option, but
finally found [prosebot[bot]](https://github.com/JasonEtco/prosebot) which
performs grammar and spelling checks in addition to other writing suggestions.

The reason why I didn't use YaSpellerCI was because it only performs spelling
checks, which is important, but probably less important.
