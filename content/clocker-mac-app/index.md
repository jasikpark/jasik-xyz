I realized that I find military time useful but it's too disorienting for me to
switch my devices to military time.

I found this:
[Clocker _Menubar World Clock_](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/clocker-menubar-world-clock/id1056643111?mt=12)
which allows you to make a world clock with multiple settings and you can set
whether the clocks are military time or normal time and it's great.

Yes, yes. I could just do math. But I don't want to.
