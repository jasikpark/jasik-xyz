I'm trying to figure out how to get webmentions workingâ€¦ I've got <https://webmention.io> setup to allow me to receive webmentions, and I think I might use <https://webmention.app> for sending them.

A test: <https://webmention.rocks/update/1>.
Testing updates: <https://webmention.rocks/update/1/part/2>.
