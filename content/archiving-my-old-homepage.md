It took a little bit of effort to achieve because I was unsure how to move it
over into my [hugo](https://gohugo.io) website. How I ended up doing it was by
moving `index.html` and `css/{main.css,zenburn.css,syntax.css}` to the `static`
folder of my hugo website.

It's at [{{< danger-ref href="/old-index-html" >}}]({{< danger-ref href="/old-index-html" >}})
