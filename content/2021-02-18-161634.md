We've been having an interesting time with the [February 13-17, 2021 Winter Storm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_13%E2%80%9317,_2021_North_American_winter_storm){{< wayback href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_13%E2%80%9317,_2021_North_American_winter_storm" >}} in Texas ðŸ¥¶. The snow was nice at first, but the ice and neighbors and friends without heat and with frozen pipes flooding their homes makes me fine with not having snow in Texas for a while.
