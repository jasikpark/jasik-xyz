Here's a list of games that you can play with your friends if you set up a Discord server or even just a group voice call!

- [skribbl.io](https://skribbl.io/) -- I've enjoyed watching this on Youtube, it's lots of fun!
- [Pretend You're Xyzzy](https://pretendyoure.xyz/zy/) -- a Cards Against Humanity clone
- [Azala](https://www.azala.info/static/index.html) -- another CaH clone
- [Never Have I Ever](https://never-have-i-ever-online.com/multiplayer/)
- [Uno](https://play.unofreak.com/)
- [Pont](https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/pont/) -- a Qwirkle clone
- [Secret Hitler](https://secrethitler.io/) -- Similar to Mafia or Avalon
- [Wanderers](https://wanderers.io/) -- I have no clue what this is, but it looks cool
- [Deeeep.io](https://deeeep.io/) -- [There's always a bigger fish](https://youtu.be/IIQVAShJzLo)

I just found [r/IoGames](https://www.reddit.com/r/IoGames/) which might be a good resource as well.
